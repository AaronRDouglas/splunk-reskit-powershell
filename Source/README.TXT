The Splunk PowerShell Resource Kit enables IT administrators to manage their Splunk topology, configure Splunk internals, and engage the Splunk search engine from their PowerShell session.  

For instance, here are a few of the tasks enabled by the resource kit; each of these tasks can be completed using a single line of PowerShell:
- Determine or change the status of Splunk services across a set of Splunk servers in parallel;
- Force one or more Splunk servers to reload their configuration, in parallel;
- Deploy  multiple Splunk forwarders to all active hosts in a Windows domain;
- Retrieve a list of Splunk server classes, optionally filtered by last deployment client connection time, associated applications, or matching patterns;
- Issue a Splunk search and format the retrieved events as a table, a list, or in a windowed grid view. 

It is strongly recommended that the user read the "Splunk PowerShell Resource Kit" cookbook documentation.
