# Splunk PowerShell Resource Kit

The Splunk PowerShell Resource Kit enables IT administrators to manage their 
Splunk topology, configure Splunk internals, and engage the Splunk search 
engine from their PowerShell session.  

## Example Uses

Here are a few of the tasks enabled by the Resource Kit:

* 	Determine or change the status of Splunk services across a set of Splunk 
	servers in parallel.
*	Force one or more Splunk servers to reload their configuration, in parallel.
*	Deploy multiple Splunk forwarders to all active hosts in a Windows domain.
*	Retrieve a list of Splunk server classes, optionally filtered by last 
	deployment client connection time, associated applications, or matching 
	patterns.
*	Issue a Splunk search and format the retrieved events as a table, a list, 
	or in a windowed grid view. 

## Documentation

Most of the documentation leaves in the "Splunk PowerShell Resource Kit 
Cookbook", which we highly recommend you read. You can find it here at
